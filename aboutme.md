<blockquote class="full-width"><p>Augmented Reality Programmer, Researcher and Enthusiast</p></blockquote>


I am Long Qian (<span lang="zh">钱隆</span>). I work as Senior R&D Engineer at [Medivis](https://www.medivis.com/).

Prior to joining Medivis, I obtained Ph.D at the Department of Computer Science at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/). My research focuses are **Augmented Reality** and **Medical Robotics**, supervised by [Dr. Peter Kazanzides](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/faculty/peter-kazanzides/) and [Dr. Nassir Navab](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/faculty/nassir-navab/). I received B.E. at the Department of Electronics Engineering at Tsinghua University, China.  [\[CV\]](/public/document/cv.pdf)
